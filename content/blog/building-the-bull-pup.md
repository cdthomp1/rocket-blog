Santa gave me a Bull Pip 12D for Christmas and I have been eagerly waiting to start this build!

I started first with the motor mount. I used JB Weld ClearWeld 5min epoxy as well as medium CA glue to assemble the motor mount.

While the motor mount was drying, I started working on the nose cone. For those that donâ€™t know, the Bull Pup comes with polymer clay to add weight to the nose of the rocket to help keep it stable. It came with two chunks of clay and I added one to the nose cone after I widened the hole with a drill to get better access inside. I figured that I would start with one chunk of clay then add more. (It might be worth doing a string test to see if I need more weight before an actual launch).

Here is the nose cone with the hole at the bottom widened to help get easier access to add the clay. I used a drill and a hobby knife to make the hole wider. This allowed me to stick a pencil in there with ease.

Here is one chunk of the clay added.

I am going to paper these fins. They probably don't need it but at the time of getting the fins ready I didn't have sand paper readily available. Going with the paper method allowed me to keep going!
